## vNotes v0.1.0b

vNotes is a mobile app dedicated to creating text notes.
This project started with the idea in mind that even apps dedicated for basic day-to-day usages are filled with unnecessary features such as signing in with official accounts like Samsung, Google, or Apple, or containing cookies / ads which can be really frustrating.With these ideas in mind, vNotes is designed to be a simple text editor for storing notes in electronic form, within just one press of a button, no unnecessary intermediate steps.
The application is currently in beta, so if you're encountering any issues with the app, feel free to [contact](#contact) the developer
